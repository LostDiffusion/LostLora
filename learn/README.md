“LDSR” stands for “Latent Diffusion Super Resolution.” Unlike most upscalers which are GAN-based (Generative Adversarial Network), LDSR is diffusion-based, just like SDXL is.

A GAN trains two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—to compete against each other to generate more authentic new data from a given training dataset; while it is much faster, less computationally intensive, and can deliver good results, it is much harder to train properly, especially for people with consumer computers; therefore, it is not as popular as diffusion models, which are much easier to train.

As for Diffusion Models, during training, what a diffusion model first does is add noise to its training images until they become a completely noisy image (think of the visual static on an old TV). Learning patterns and attributes from the training images (but not saving those images directly into the weights), it makes a new noise image, and then reverses the process based on what it’s learned to create a new image. This process is called _reverse-diffusion,_ where latent visual noise (the latent space is a space much smaller than the pixel space [48 times smaller with SD] so it can actually run on our computers; it’s where all the calculations are done before translating it to the human-readable pixel space via the Variational Encoder/Decoder [VAE]) is removed from a pure noise image—or another type of image you give it—which then becomes a new, novel image based on the patterns and attributes it has learned. Text conditioning is also applied and labeled with all the images so that it can create novel images that correspond to what one has typed.

While LDSR is slower, it delivers sharper and generally better and more “intelligent” results compared to ordinary GAN upscalers—perfect for upscaling afterward with SDXL so it catches all the details (for the second part after the LDSR upscale, the next SD upscale just utilized a normal GAN upscaler, which was 8x-NMKD…, as LSDR has already done the heavy lifting). I’ve found that it makes SDXL upscaling feasible, making it an essential step in my process
