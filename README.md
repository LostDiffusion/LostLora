Collection of LoRA that may potentially be lost. Note I am especially partial to LoRA who's developers want it kept around.

## Updates

* October 2024: Uggh! Just realized basic Github has a limit of 25MB per file! I may have to raise some money for storage space!

## Searching

Contrary to popular belief (of non-Github users), HuggingFace does have a search feature that is definitely useful:

Github in general, including this repo, is also easy to search using the Search tool at the top of the screen:
